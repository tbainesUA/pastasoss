    "This notebook demonstrates how to use the `PASTASOSS` package to rapidly generate the trace positions for NIRISS/SOSS observations, in addition we include and example SOSS observation. `PASTASOSS` uses reference models of trace positions for commanded position of the GR700XD, for order 1 and 2. We apply a rotation transform to reference models to derive the trace positions for any given pupil wheel position angle that is included in the FITS header using the keyword `PWCPOS`. The associate wavelength for each trace positions will be added to the tool at a later date to provide a complete picture with sub-pixel performance. Future iterations of this will include update models for spectral traces positions and will eventually include support for order 3. "
